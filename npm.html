    <h3>The NPM Universe</h3>

    <p style="overflow: auto;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="overflow: auto;">Even though JavaScript code will run natively in the browser or by executing it with
      node,
      modern developers need a working understanding of how to make our way around the NPM universe.</p>
    <p>The trick is to know that:</p>
    <div style="display: flex;">
      <p style="margin: auto; padding: 1rem; border: 4px double green; width: max-content;">All roads lead to and from
        the
        package.json file.</p>
    </div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Not only does package.json give instructions to npm on how a project gets tested and/or built, it is also meant
      to
      be readable (and editable) by developers to get a working project.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4><strong>What is meant by the json extension</strong></h4>
    <p>The phrase json (properly pronounced jay-sun, not jays-on) comes from JavaScript Object Notation. Douglas
      Crockford
      created the json file format in the early 2000s to store data in a simple human-readable format. While it was
      created for JavaScript, its usefulness and popularity have made it a standard file format for other languages and
      uses as well.</p>
    <p>So, json is based on JavaScript objects but is not exactly the same. You can get a full discussion of the jason
      syntax at <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_syntax.asp" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">w3schools</a> or at <a href="https://jsonapi.org/" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">https://jsonapi.org/</a>.</p>
    <p>If you look at any package.json file, you'll see that everything is contained within a {} pair. Then you'll see
      that there are name/value pairs. A name/value pair consists of the property name (in double quotes), followed by a
      colon, followed by the value (in double quotes):&nbsp;</p>
    <pre><code style="padding: 0.25rem; width: max-content;">"test": "jest"</code></pre>
    <p>Additionally, name/value pairs can be collected into groups using another set of {} and commas:</p>
    <pre><code style="padding: 0.25rem; width: max-content;">"scripts": {
    "test": "jest",
    "prepare": "husky install",
    "pre-commit": "lint-staged"
  },
</code></pre>
    <p>The above snippet from a package.json file shows that the property named "scripts" is a list of commands that npm
      can run when asked. For complex projects, a package.json file may have a long list of scripts.</p>
    <p>NOTE: The json datatype is also extremely important as the most common way for a server to serve data to a client
      using <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-is-a-rest-api" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">REST APIs</a>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3><strong>What is code linting and eslint</strong></h3>
    <p>Linting is the automated process of scanning and analyzing code looking for errors and non-adherence to
      best-practice standards.</p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px; padding: 1rem; border: 1px solid #030303; width: max-content;"><iframe
        title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HDQXWr5TOnI" width="560" height="315"
        allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></div>
    <p>&nbsp;Here is a list of positives when using a linter:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>find buggy code from syntax errors and typos</li>
      <li>highlight potential logical errors</li>
      <li>highlight dangerous (like using the eval function)</li>
      <li>flag non-adherence to coding style guide standards and conventions</li>
      <li>stop you from committing buggy code that will cause issues later</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The npm package called eslint is currently the most popular linter for JavaScript. It is popular because of its
      flexibility and its wonderful documentation at <a href="https://eslint.org/" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">https://eslint.org/</a>.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4><strong>Eslint runs from a configuration file</strong></h4>
    <p>Eslint operates from an exhaustive set of rules that you can find at <a href="https://eslint.org/docs/rules/"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://eslint.org/docs/rules/</a>. These rules cover code practices that can be
      problematic.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Many of these rules can have situations where breaking the rule is not only permissible, but preferred.</p>
    <p>For example, production code meant for the browser should normally not have console.log() statements in them. It
      is
      not considered best practice.&nbsp; You can find the no-console rule in the documentation at <a
        href="https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-console" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-console</a>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In other situations, like running a node app, console.log() is expected, which means that rule has to be turned
      off.</p>
    <p>Choosing to define console.log() as an error or not is only one example. Each project will have its own do's and
      don'ts when it comes to writing good code.</p>
    <p>For this reason, an eslint installation expects ways to configure it to help define what should be enforced and
      to
      what level of enforcement these rules should have.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4><strong>The eslint configuration file</strong></h4>
    <p>To put it simply, eslint is not easy to configure. Luckily, it does have a tool to help you get started.</p>
    <p>When you run <code>npx eslint --init</code> from the command line, it will ask you questions and write a useable
      configuration file from your answers. That makes a good starting point. <a
        href="https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/</a>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The configuration file will typically be in the root folder of your project. Unfortunately, the format of the
      file
      can differ depending on the developer's preferences. <a
        href="https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/configuration-files#configuration-file-formats"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/configuration-files#configuration-file-formats</a>&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p><strong><span style="color: #169179;">The preference format for the eslint configuration file for this class is
          .eslintrc.json</span></strong></p>
    <p>Here is an example <a class="inline_disabled"
        href="https://gist.github.com/cynthiateeters/9a95c06f8e1a4a713e0194fb07df84c8" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">.eslintrc.json file</a> &nbsp;</p>
    <p>Open it up and take a look. You can tell it is probably for a node project because it turns off the no-console
      rule.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4><strong>Eslint has a VS Code extension</strong></h4>
    <p>You can combine eslint with its VS Code extension of the same name. <a
        href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint</a>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>NOTE: the extension needs the tool installed and configured before it will
          work.</strong></span></p>
    <p>The eslint extension takes eslint's configuration and applies it to the code when it is open inside your editor.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4><strong>The squigglies and making them disappear</strong></h4>
    <p>If the eslint extension finds a problem, it puts a colored squiggly line underneath anything that does not adhere
      to that long list of rules.</p>
    <p>Red means the code is considered to be an error and yellow is a warning.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<img src="images/red-squiggly-1.png" alt="example of a red squiggly error" width="257" height="61"
        data-api-endpoint="https://raritanval.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/3328453/files/217992562"
        data-api-returntype="File" /></p>
    <p>When you <strong>hover the mouse over a squiggly</strong>, the extension will tell you about one or more
      problems.
    </p>
    <p><img src="images/red-squiggly-hover.png" alt="shows hover when mouse is on red squiggly" width="434" height="108"
        data-api-endpoint="https://raritanval.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/3328453/files/217992654"
        data-api-returntype="File" /></p>
    <p>So, this example shows that using the var keyword is breaking the no-var rule that is currently set to "error".
      The
      suggestion is to use either let or const.</p>
    <p>In fact, this one line of code has 2 errors, as we will see in the next screen shot.</p>
    <p>In the hover pop-up, you are given two links. The first link "View Problem" will open up the rule into a larger
      popup.</p>
    <p>The second link opens up a pull-down set of actions that you can take to make the red squiggly go away.</p>
    <p><img src="images/eslint-actions.png" alt="list of actions the eslint extension can take" width="406" height="255"
        data-api-endpoint="https://raritanval.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/3328453/files/217992949"
        data-api-returntype="File" /></p>
    <p><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>And, yes, best practice says you need to make each and every squiggly go
          away
          as soon as possible.</strong></span></p>
    <p>If at all possible, my go-to action is "Fix all auto-fixable..." or "Fix this..."</p>
    <p>When I choose to fix this example, the var is automatically changed to a const.</p>
    <p>That reveals my second error: <code style="padding: 0.25rem;">example</code> appears no other place in the code
      and
      is, therefore, unused. There is no quick fix for this. I have to now think why I have an unused variable and what
      should be done about it.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4><strong>Eslint comments to disable rules</strong></h4>
    <p><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>NOTE: You should only disable rules when you know why you are doing
          disabling.</strong></span></p>
    <p>The above screen shot shows actions that start with the word "Disable". These actions, if chosen, will
      automatically place an eslint comment that disables the rule.</p>
    <p>Remember, if you need to disable (turn off) a rule for a whole project, you should put that into the
      .eslintrc.json
      file.</p>
    <p>If you need to disable a rule per file, the comment goes at the top of the file.</p>
    <p><img src="images/eslint-file-disable.png" alt="screen shot of eslint comments at the top of file" width="429"
        height="121" data-api-endpoint="https://raritanval.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/3328453/files/217994063"
        data-api-returntype="File" /></p>
    <p>If you want eslint to ignore a rule for only one line of code, the comment can go right before the line.</p>
    <p><img src="images/eslint-disable-one-line.png" alt="screen shot use eslint comment to disable one line"
        width="493" height="65"
        data-api-endpoint="https://raritanval.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/3328453/files/217994215"
        data-api-returntype="File" /></p>
    <p>These eslint comments are super because, not only do they inform the eslint tool, they also inform other coders
      as
      to what assumptions have been made.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3><strong>What are code style guides and Airbnb</strong></h3>
    <p>A style guide is a set of standards adopted by an organization to standardize the development of a product and
      reduce inconsistencies. In web development you can have design style guides where the organization has dictated
      properties like allowable color, typography, buttons, etc.</p>
    <p>You can also have coding style guides that dictate how code is written. The most popular JavaScript style guide
      is
      the one created and maintained by Airbnb, <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/javascript" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">https://github.com/airbnb/javascript</a>. This style guide is remarkably well-written and reading
      their rules can help one learn JavaScript. For each rule there is a discussion of why followed by both bad and
      good
      examples.</p>
    <h3><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>
    <h3><strong>What are code formatters and Prettier</strong></h3>
    <p>Let's say different lines of your code have extra spaces inserted here and there and in other places you haven't
      necessarily used spaces. The JavaScript engine ignores extra whitespace, so this is not a code error.</p>
    <p>These lines could be a problem if you have adopted a style guide where allowable spaces are defined. You could go
      over over each line fixing these problems manually. But, oh, what a pain.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Welcome code formatters. Just like linters automatically check code for errors, formatters automatically fix code
      for violations to a style guide.</p>
    <p>Prettier, which has a VS Code extension, has become the most popular formatter. You can configure Prettier to
      work
      as you type, as you save a file, and before you commit changes to your repo. A common choice is to select "Format
      on
      save" in your VS Code settings.&nbsp;</p>
